# Cloud-Scale Analytics Scenario - Data Management Zone

## Objective

The [Cloud-Scale Analytics Scenario](https://aka.ms/adopt/cloudscaleanalytics) provides a prescriptive data platform design coupled with Azure best practices and design principles. These principles serve as a compass for subsequent design decisions across critical technical domains. The architecture will continue to evolve alongside the Azure platform and is ultimately driven by the various design decisions that organizations must make to define their Azure data journey.

The Cloud-Scale Analytics architecture consists of two core building blocks:

1. *Data Management Landing Zone* which provides all data management and data governance capabilities for the data platform of an organization.
1. *Data Landing Zone* which is a logical construct and a unit of scale in the Cloud-Scale Analytics architecture that enables data retention and execution of data workloads for generating insights and value with data.


**The Data Management Zone (this repository) must be deployed prior to any Data Landing Zones**
